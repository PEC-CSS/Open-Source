  I personally did basic SQL from Computer Science with C++ Sumita Arora class 12 Volume 2 - chapter 12. The chapter is well
  written but I won't recommend buying a book just for a single chapter(I already had the book since I learnt C++ from there)
  so you can prefer any online resource for basic sql.
  
  For intermediate and advanced topics of SQL, You can go through this tutorial :
  https://bipp.io/sql-tutorial/basic-sql/sql-select-from-where-statement/
  follow the tutorial and keep playing with the queries side-by-side.
  Other leftover topics can be covered from w3school
  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/
  
  CTE topic is not covered in any of the above metioned links so you can read it from here :
  https://www.sqlshack.com/sql-server-common-table-expressions-cte/
  
  All this would provide you with all the required theory for SQL, now comes the practising part :)
  For practising SQL queries :

  Cover all the questions and also refer to the Solution Discussions section
