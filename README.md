### How to Contribute
There are several issues marked in the __Issues__ section. These include the questions with appropriate labels (if you are new to contributing we recommend you filter by good-first-issue label). Clicking on an open issue will show you the problem statement. Read that carefully and code what is asked for (sometimes the expected complexity of the solution may be marked).

__NOTE__ : If you are solving any Issue, make sure you create a new branch, mention the Issue ID in the title of your Pull request and adhere to the [Code of conduct and Coding style](https://github.com/PEC-CSS/Open-Source#for-contributors).

* If you are a complete beginner install the below resources:
	* You would first need to [install GIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7fD92g-gE)
	* We recommend you use VSCode for making changes. [Download Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 

* Here's how you can create your first Pull Request(PR):
	* [Specific to our repository](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QoXaWDvIwgksPrwogE2JHzcoZqa7MQib/view)
	* [Or a general detailed explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuL60r-XnL4)

### For Contributors
It's our pleasure that you are considering contributing to this repository. We hope that this repository can be used by learners from PEC, or anywhere in the world. Being one of the contributors, you must adhere to the following __Code of Conduct__:
- Please make sure that the solution you are submitting has not already been added or a PR has already been raised. You should check that before submitting your PR.
- Check the label for the Issue you are solving, for example if it's good-first-issue then add your solution file in the Good-First-Issue folder and name the file appropiately or use the title itself (Print_Subsets_of_Array.cpp) 

#### Coding Style
- You can use any programming language you want.
- It is recommended that you use concepts of _Object Oriented Programming_ and _Functions_. Their names must be intuitive and should make their purpose clear to the readers.
- Use proper naming conventions for the language you are coding in. If you're not familiar with them, here are the conventions for [C++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io/develop/naming-conventions/) and [Python](https://pythonguides.com/python-naming-conventions).
- Make proper use of comments/docstrings wherever necessary but do not use them for stuff too trivial.
- If you are modifying documentation/comments, make sure your language is concise.
- You can also add the _algorithm explanation_ as a comment if you wish to.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- And the most important thing: Have fun coding!
