ii# Contributing guidelines

## Before contributing

## Contributing
### For contributors
It's our pleasure that you are considering contributing to this repository. We hope that this repository can be used by learners from PEC, or anywhere in the world. Being one of the contributors, you must adhere to the following __Code of Conduct__:
- Implementations different from the existing ones for a particular problem are welcome! You can code up a solution with a different approach, with reduced complexities and in different languages, too. But, please make sure that the solution you are submitting has not already been __implemented identically__. You should check that before submitting your PR.
- We also welcome improvements in __comments__ and __proper tests__. 

### Contribution
Please read this section carefully if you are contributing your work: <br />
There are several issues marked in the __Issues__ section. These include the questions with approproate labels. Clicking on an open issue will show you the problem statement. Read that carefully and code what is asked for (sometimes the expected complexity of the solution may be marked).
#### Coding Style
- You can use any programming language you want.
- It is recommended that you use concepts of _Object Oriented Programming_ and _Functions_. Their names must be intuitive and should make their purpose clear to the readers.
- Use proper naming conventions for the language you are coding in. If you're not familiar with them, here are the conventions for [C++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io/develop/naming-conventions/) and [Python](https://pythonguides.com/python-naming-conventions).
- Make proper use of comments/docstrings wherever necessary but do not use them for stuff too trivial.
- Include proper testcases with their expected outputs in the comments/docstrings.
- Avoid importing libraries for basic algorithms.
- If you are modifying documentation/comments/tests, make sure your language is concise.
- You can also add the _algorithm explanation_ as a comment if you wish to.
- And the most important thing: Have fun coding!
