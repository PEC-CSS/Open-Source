I have personally used 'Introduction to Algorithms - CLRS' book for learning Data Structures and Algo. It is the best book if you want to learn DSA in depth. There is literally no book better than CLRS so far for DSA. You can also refer to courses online, using CLRS as a reference book. Some courses that I used :
1) https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/ .Though this course is not that great but its explanation of theory is good. You can buy this course at Rs. 360 when the price drops during festivals.
2) https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox . This is a great course on coursera for algo. All the competitive coders usually have this course done. You can get it for free by using financial aid( search the process online ).

For competitive coding, You can start with HackerRank as a beginner and shift to Codechef or Codeforce later.

1. Theoretical part
Mycodeschool playlists- https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool (time complexity, data structures, searching, sorting, pointers, recursion)
Coursera - Algorithmic toolbox - https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox
C++ STL: Rachit Jain - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-1Cn3ccwXY , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOHXdhtxyyQ
DP, Stack, Queues, etc - Aditya Verma - https://www.youtube.com/c/AdityaVermaTheProgrammingLord/playlists
Codeforces, hackerearth and other blogs (studying specific topics)

2. Practice
Interviewbit - https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/
Leetcode - https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/
Geeksforgeeks - https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?page=1
Hackerearth - https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/

3. Competitive programming
Codeforces  - https://codeforces.com/
Codechef - https://www.codechef.com/

4. Tips
Study time complexity and other basic topics and get started with practicing. Learn new concepts on the go. Always try to upsolve (solve problems that you weren't able to solve in competitive programming contests) and stay consistent. Consistency is THE MOST important. You won't be able to solve any problems in the starting and that's normal. Just keep going and you'll eventually get there. Try to come out of your comfort zone, that is, try solving problems that are a little above your level and challenge you. Consistency is key. Solving 10 problems in 1 day and relaxing for the remaining week isn't going to help. Solve 1 challenging problem everyday. Start as soon as you can. All the best!

Geeksforgeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ ) is the best source for preparation. You can solve questions depending on the topic you feel you need improvement and also company wise questions give you a good idea of how and to what level to prepare for a specific company.

I started with geeks for geeks for preparing for my internship. I did coding questions topic wise and after coding I did Cse core subjects from the books and then practicing Questions on gfg.

For preparing for my placements I did coding on leetcode platform and for the cse core subjects went through gfg notes.

Competitive coding needs data structures and algorithms as it's foundation. I found University of California's Data structures and Algorithms Specialization really insightfull. It helped me understand DS really well. It can be audited on Coursera.

For compi coding you just gotta keep doing it regularly
For DS/Algo for interview I am following a list from love babbar, 450 questions everything covered 3 months needed if done consistently and slowly.
Its a really really nice list.

There is no need to spend time on learning syntax of different programming languages. Learn one programming language C/C++/java, then start solving questions on any platform one finds comfortable (I used do hackerrank).I used to Google syntax and new data structures whenever i got stuck. Coding ninjas DSA course is really helpful, i did their competitive programming course that too half. But I would recommend to complete DSA course. After this icourserat's all practice. I used to do Codechef monthly long challenge, from those challenges i learnt a lot and gained confidence. I did this all in my first year, after first year i didn't do competitive programming. My point is that, don't waste time on gathering resources and thinking where to start, where to practice for only competitive programming. There is lot of other things to do/study in college.

1) DSA - Geeks For Geeks
2) DSA Practice - Leetcode, GFG, Interviewbit
3) CP - I personally suggest to learn it through practice only.
4) Websites for CP in order of how you should start and move forward (my personal opinion):
- Hackerrank
- Codechef
- Codeforces
