  Dart is one of the most beautiful object oriented programming language out there.
  In order to get started with Flutter App Dev, Dart is the language you would need to know first.
  I found Dart to be a flexible combination C++ and Python.
  
  There is a well documented language tour guide available for Dart which I used to get hands on Dart.
  https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour
  If you have done a programming language previously, you can just cover the basics of this language including the null safety feature of Dart, variable declaration, lazy initialisation, basic syntax and how it is different from the language that you might have done.
  
  For a quick summary of the language:
  https://dart.dev/codelabs/dart-cheatsheet
  
  You need not install Dart to learn it. You can use Dart Pad to learn and code side-by-side :
