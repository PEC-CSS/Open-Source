  There are numerous online resources for learning python. 
  I learned python from Computer Science with Python by Sumita arora class XII book. It is pretty descriptive and covered almost all the topics.
  
  To dive deep into multiple uses of python and to integrate it with databases, Web etc. , I referred to these coursera courses:
  - https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python
  - https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python
